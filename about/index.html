    <p>I have a solid track record in defining problem statements, defining metrics, and delivering solutions. In my current role as a Senior Data Scientist at Noice, I am responsible for structuring and creating a data platform project and implementing MLOps processes. I have also improved the click-through rate by designing and developing scoring algorithms for the search engine.</p>
<p>Prior to this, I served as a Senior Data Scientist at Ruangguru, where I managed and co-developed machine learning deployment projects. I also worked closely with the sales team to develop a model to score, segment, and rank users, leading to increased subscription rates.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to the development and deployment of multiple data science products, including search engines, recommendation systems, marketing attribution, and knowledge tracing. I have also worked on various NLP projects, including a Named Entity Recognition and a customer service chatbot.</p>
