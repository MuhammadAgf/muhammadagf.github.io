      <description>to answer:
 Is there a relationship between feature advertising budget and sales? How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales? Which media are associated with sales? How large is the association between each medium and slaes? How accurately we can predict future sales? Is there synergy among the advertising media?  Single Linear Regression    $$ Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$$
RSS (Residual Sum Squared)    let $\hat{y_i} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} x_i$ be the prediction of $y$ based on the $i$th value of $X$.</description>

      <description>statistical model that models the probability of an event taking place by having the log-odds of an event be a linear combination of one or more independent variables. since logistic regression fit a model in the form $p(y|x)$ directly, it&amp;rsquo;s called discriminative approach.
$$ p(y|x,w) = Ber(y|sigm(w^Tx))$$ where sigm is a sigmoid function: $$sigm(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$
model fitting    MLE    the negative log-likelihood for logistic regression is given by $$NLL(w) = -\sum_{i=1}^N y_i log(\mu_i) + (1-y_i)log(1-\mu_i)$$ this is also called **cross entropy** error function.</description>
