      <description>Use Cases:    Offering a new product or capability:    When introducing a new service like speech recognition, a common design pattern is to start with a small amount of traffic and gradually increase it.
Automating or assisting existing tasks:    If a task previously performed by humans, like inspecting smartphones for defects, can be automated or assisted by a learning algorithm, a shadow mode deployment can be used.</description>

      <description>Scoping:
 Define the project. Decide on key metrics. Estimate resources, and timeline.    Data:
 Define data.  establish a baselines, and address data labeling inconsistencies.   Standardize data labeling conventions.    Modeling: 3 key input: Code (algorithm/model), Hyperparameter, Data.
 Select and train the model while optimizing data and hyperparameters. Perform error analysis in machine learning to identify areas for improvement.</description>

      <description>ML/Statistical Issue:    Given a data X, model F and output y, we have Issue called: Concept drift and Data drift.
Concept Drift    refer to when desired mapping from X to y changes. for example due to inflation, same size of the house can be priced higher.
Data Drift    refer to when the input distribution (X) changes. for example when most people suddenly build a smaller house.</description>
