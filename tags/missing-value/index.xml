      <description>It involves building a decision tree model using the non-missing data and then using the tree model to predict the missing values. Here are some pros and cons of tree-based imputation:
Pros:
 It can handle non-linear relationships between the variables and non-monotonic missing data patterns. It can impute both continuous and categorical variables. It can be less prone to bias compared to other imputation methods.  Cons:
 It can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with large datasets.</description>
