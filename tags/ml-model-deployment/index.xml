      <description>Infrastructure for Model Serving    two main options for infrastructure:
  On-Premises: In this approach, you have all the hardware and software required for running your models on your own premises.
 pros: provides you with complete control and flexibility to adapt to changes quickly. cons: it can be complicated and expensive to procure, install, configure, and maintain the hardware infrastructure.    Cloud Provider: Alternatively, you can outsource your infrastructure needs to a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure.</description>
