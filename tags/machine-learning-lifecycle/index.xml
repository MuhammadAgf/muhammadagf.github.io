      <description>Data Drift and Skew     Drift refers to changes in data over time. It occurs when there are changes in the statistical properties of the features between different time periods or data collections. Skew is the difference between two versions of the same dataset from different sources. It can be caused by changes in the data schema or distribution.  Model Decay and Data Issues     Model decay refers to the decline in model performance over time, which is often caused by data drift and concept drift.</description>

      <description>Preprocessing      Data Cleansing: To eliminate or correct erroneous data by identifying and handling inconsistencies or outliers.
  Scaling and Normalizing: Numerical features often need to be scaled or normalized to ensure the models can learn effectively. Scaling adjusts the range of features, while normalization brings them within a specific range, such as between 0 and 1.
  Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features by creating a lower-dimensional representation of the data.</description>

      <description>Data augmentation is a valuable technique for increasing the amount of data available for training machine learning models, particularly for unstructured data like images, audio, and text.
However, when applying data augmentation, it is important to make thoughtful decisions. Here are some best practices to consider:
  Goal of Data Augmentation: The purpose of data augmentation is to generate examples that challenge the learning algorithm, while still being recognizable by humans or a baseline algorithm.</description>

      <title>Data Labeling Conventions</title>

      <description>Improving Label Consistency    To enhance the consistency of labels in a project, follow these steps:
  Multiple Labelers: If label consistency is a concern, select a few examples and have multiple labelers assign labels to them. This approach helps identify inconsistencies among labelers.
  Relabeling: Allow the same labeler to relabel an example after a break or time gap, encouraging consistency even within individual labelers.</description>

      <description>How long should you spend obtaining data?    source: https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-machine-learning-in-production/lecture/Y7zTm/obtaining-data
  Define the data requirements: Determine what data is needed for the project, including the definition of the target variable (y) and input variables (x).
  Time investment: Consider the time spent on obtaining data in relation to the iterative process of machine learning. It is recommended to enter the iteration loop quickly by not spending excessive time on data collection initially.</description>

      <description>When training a learning algorithm for the first time, it is expected that it won&amp;rsquo;t work perfectly right away. The key to improving its performance lies in error analysis. By analyzing the errors made by the algorithm, we can determine the most efficient use of our time in improving its performance.
Example: Speech Recognition Error Analysis    To illustrate the error analysis process, let&amp;rsquo;s consider an example of speech recognition.</description>

      <description>When starting a machine learning project, it is essential to establish a baseline level of performance before making improvements. This baseline serves as a point of comparison and helps determine where to focus efforts.
Establishing a Baseline     Determine major categories in your data. for speech recognition: (e.g., clear speech, speech with car noise, speech with people noise, low bandwidth audio). Measure accuracy for each category (e.</description>

      <title>Get Started In Modelling</title>

      <guid>https://muhammadagf.github.io/posts/notes/get-started-in-modelling/</guid>
      <description>Tips for Getting Started    When starting a machine learning project, there are several tips to consider for efficient progress.
Getting Started on Modeling     Conduct a literature search to understand existing approaches and possibilities. Focus on practical implementations instead of the latest algorithms. Open source implementations can provide a baseline and facilitate quick start. A reasonable algorithm with good data often outperforms a cutting-edge algorithm with poor data.</description>

      <description>Use Cases:    Offering a new product or capability:    When introducing a new service like speech recognition, a common design pattern is to start with a small amount of traffic and gradually increase it.
Automating or assisting existing tasks:    If a task previously performed by humans, like inspecting smartphones for defects, can be automated or assisted by a learning algorithm, a shadow mode deployment can be used.</description>

      <description>ML/Statistical Issue:    Given a data X, model F and output y, we have a data distribution changes Issue called: Concept drift and Data drift.
Concept Drift    refer to when desired mapping from X to y changes. for example due to inflation, same size of the house can be priced higher.
Data Drift    refer to when the input distribution (X) changes. for example when most people suddenly build a smaller house.</description>
