      <description>When starting a machine learning project, it is essential to establish a baseline level of performance before making improvements. This baseline serves as a point of comparison and helps determine where to focus efforts.
Establishing a Baseline     Determine major categories in your data. for speech recognition: (e.g., clear speech, speech with car noise, speech with people noise, low bandwidth audio). Measure accuracy for each category (e.</description>

      <description>Tips for Getting Started    When starting a machine learning project, there are several tips to consider for efficient progress.
Getting Started on Modeling     Conduct a literature search to understand existing approaches and possibilities. Focus on practical implementations instead of the latest algorithms. Open source implementations can provide a baseline and facilitate quick start. A reasonable algorithm with good data often outperforms a cutting-edge algorithm with poor data.</description>

      <title>Ml Deployment Patterns And Degrees Of Automation</title>

      <description>Use Cases:    Offering a new product or capability:    When introducing a new service like speech recognition, a common design pattern is to start with a small amount of traffic and gradually increase it.
Automating or assisting existing tasks:    If a task previously performed by humans, like inspecting smartphones for defects, can be automated or assisted by a learning algorithm, a shadow mode deployment can be used.</description>

      <description>Scoping:
 Define the project. Decide on key metrics. Estimate resources, and timeline.    Data:
 Define data.  establish a baselines, and address data labeling inconsistencies.   Standardize data labeling conventions.    Modeling: 3 key input: Code (algorithm/model), Hyperparameter, Data.
 Select and train the model while optimizing data and hyperparameters. Perform error analysis in machine learning to identify areas for improvement.</description>

      <description>ML/Statistical Issue:    Given a data X, model F and output y, we have Issue called: Concept drift and Data drift.
Concept Drift    refer to when desired mapping from X to y changes. for example due to inflation, same size of the house can be priced higher.
Data Drift    refer to when the input distribution (X) changes. for example when most people suddenly build a smaller house.</description>
