      <description>special class of random variable
X = number of success given N trial with p probability of each success on each trial where each trial are independent with each other.
properties:     made of independent trials each trials can be classified as success or failure fixed # of trials probability of success on each trial is constant  Binomial distribution    special case of probability mass function from a binomial variable pmf if the probability of success is p, the probability of having exactly k success given n trial is given by:</description>

      <description>PMF for a disscrete random variable X: $p(X)$
Mean (Expectation)    *the sum of the weighted possible values of X (sum of $p(X=x)x$ ) Tip  $$\mu = E[X] = \sum_{x} x p(X=x)$$  Variance    measure the spread of a PMF (Average Squared Distance from the mean) Tip  $$\sigma^2 = Var[X] = E[(X-\mu)^2] = E[(X-E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$$  calculation: using the expected value rules: $$Var[X] = E[(X-\mu)^2] = E[g(x)] = \sum_x g(x)p(X=x) = \sum_x (x-\mu)^2p(X=x) $$ Info  $$Var[X] = \sum_x (x-\mu)^2p(X=x) $$  $$Var[X] = E[(X-\mu)^2] = E[X^2 - 2X\mu + \mu^2] $$ $$Var[X] = E[(X-\mu)^2] = E[X^2] - 2\mu E[X] + \mu^2 $$ $$Var[X] = E[X^2] - 2 (E[X])^2 + E[X]^2 $$ Info  $$Var[X] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 $$   References    [1] https://socratic.</description>
