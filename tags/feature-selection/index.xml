Some popular techniques:
Categorical Feature when the target is categorical the relationship between feature and outcome forms a contingency tables. 3 or more level for the feature: can use chi-squared test or exact methods 2 level for the feature: can use odds-ratio when the target is numeric 2 level for the feature: basic t-test can be calculated 3 level for the feature: traditional ANOVA F-statistic can be calculated Numeric Feature when the target is categorical similar as when feature is categorical and the target is numeric (but the role is reversed) correlation-adjusted t-scores are a good alternative to simple ANOVA statistics.</description></item></channel></rss>
